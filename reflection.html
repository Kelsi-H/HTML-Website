        <p>This project has been so fun, and I ended up enjoying the process of building a website from scratch a lot more than I thought I would.
        In the past I’ve made websites, but I used website builders to help me, like Wix and Weebly, so I never had to code anything I just made it look pretty! 
        Whereas this time around I had to do everything myself, which was a huge challenge for me. However, I ended up learning so many new skills that I will definitely 
        be using in future projects, such as how to use the grid system, creating different classes, and using bootstrap to support me.
        <br>
        <br>
        When I first started using html everything looked so alien to me and I had no idea what anything meant, by now at the end of the project I can 
        actually read and understand all my code. I am really proud of how my website turned out. I definitely had to simplify some things from my original design, as certain 
        things I don’t quite know how to do yet. Some of my favourite things include the colour scheme and design. I really wanted this website to reflect me as much as possible, 
        and so I decided to use a lot of my favourite colours throughout the website to create a very cozy retro vibe. I also love the personal touches throughout. All the photos 
        I used are ones I have taken myself from rather my hometown or here in Bristol! 
        <br>
        <br>
        Next time I would love to push myself further using the grid system and see what page layouts I can create, as the ones I had originally designed were too hard for my 
        current skill level. I would also love to learn how to use coloured texts boxes for my next website, as I tried using them in this one but couldn’t figure out how to get 
        it to work in a responsive website. 
        <br>
        <br>
        In conclusion I am super happy with my personal portfolio, as well as my figma design for my website and my three graphic compositions. I cant wait to move onto my
        final project for semester two and use so many of the skills I have learnt, as well as learn many new skills.</p>
