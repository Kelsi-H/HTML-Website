      <p class="text-left">Hey! if you didn't already know my name is Kelsi. I am originally from a small seaside town in Cornwall called Bude. 
        Growing up living by the sea and being surrounded by nature constantly was such a privilege I will always be grateful for. 
        It taught me to appreciate the small moments in life and take things at a slower pace. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Some of my favourite things to do in my spare time are: 
        Sketching/Doodling, Spending time with family and friends, 
        Playing video games  (I am an absolute nerd when it comes to video games), Listening to my favourite music,
        Playing guitar; especially with my mates, Surfing and swimming, Helping my parents out around the farm, and spending time with my dog!

        <h2>Fun Fact!</h2>
        <p style="color: #929381;">I used to want to be an Actor! I even studied acting at college for two years before I decided it wasn’t the path I wanted to go down. 
        <br>
        <br>
        The main productions I have been in, and the ones I’m most proud of, are Antigone by Sophocles and Replica by Titas Holder.
        <br> 
        <br>
        Acting really brought out a different side to me and helped me gain my confidence. It is also what introduced me into media! 
        I was apart of a short film in my second year.  The director showed me the process of post-production and I absolutely loved seeing how
        edited everything and created all the promotional content for the film and from that moment I started to consider doing a Media course
        in University if I didn't end up doing acting (which I didnt) </p>
