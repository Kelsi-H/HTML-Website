      <p>Hey! if you didn't already know my name is Kelsi.
      <br>
      <br>
      I am originally from a small seaside town in Cornwall called Bude. 
      Growing up living by the sea and being surrounded by nature constantly was such a privilege I will always be grateful for. 
      It taught me to appreciate the small moments in life and take things at a slower pace. 
      <br>
      <br>
      Some of my favourite things to do in my spare time are: 
      <br>
      <br>
      Sketching/Doodling, Spending time with family and friends,
      Playing video games  (I am an absolute nerd when it comes to video games), Listening to my favourite music, 
      Playing guitar; especially with my mates, Surfing and swimming, Helping my parents out around the farm, and spending time with my dog!</p>

      <h3>Fun Fact!</h3>
      <P>I used to want to be an Actor! I even studied acting at college for two years before I decided it wasn’t the path I wanted to go down. 
      The main productions I have been in, and the ones I’m most proud of, are Antigone by Sophocles and Replica by Titas Holder. 
      Acting really brought out a different side to me and helped me gain my confidence. It is also what introduced me into media! I was apart
      of a short film in my second year.  The director showed me the process of post-production and I absolutely loved seeing how edited
      everything and created all the promotional content for the film and from that moment I started to consider doing a Media course in 
      University if I didn't end up doing acting (which I didnt)</P>
