        <h2>Principles of 3D Environment</h2>
        <div class="text">
          <p>For this Module we had to create a 3D robot using a software called Maya. This was my first time ever creating a 
          3D model and I won’t lie I had a lot more fun than I thought I would!
          <br>
          <br>
          Learning how to use Maya, as well as all the tools it has was quite stressful at first as I had no idea what I was
          doing but after practising I had so much fun creating my robot. 
          <br>
          <br>
          For the design I mainly looked for inspiration from video games and movies. I used the model from the game Astro Bot
          for the main inspiration and then tweaked it to fit my own personal ideas.</p>

          <h2>Creative Coding</h2>
          <p>For our assignment in Creative Coding we are working on creating three images we will create in P5 JavaScript.
          The inspiration for my images is geometrical flowers. Growing up in the countryside has made me absolutely love nature, 
          and so I wanted to incorporate that into this assignment and so I drew three geometric flowers based off of some images
          I found online.
          <br>
          <br>
          Creative Coding has been a huge challenge for me as I have never coded before in my life, and at times it feels like
          I am learning a whole new language! I do love the process of coding (at least when it works) and can’t wait to see
          what I create in the future.</p>

          <h2>Media Studio</h2>
          <p>For my Media studio module we are currently working on creating a 45 second 2D Animation based on the United Nations
          Sustainable Development Goals. I am creating an animation to highlight how important farming is to help stop world hunger.
          <br>
          <br>
          My favourite part so far has been creating my animation drawings. I love drawing so much in my day to day life and so being
          able to use this skill in my course digitally has been so much fun! Im very excited to continue working on this assignment
          and see the end product!</p>
